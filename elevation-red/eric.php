								<p>I came to Woodhaven with a wealth of life experience in both the arts and human services. I was a professional musician for many years. Later, I went back to school to pursue my interests in serving some of the most vulnerable populations including the aging and chronically ill. This pursuit led me to gain valuable experience working in a variety of different human service and social work settings, and to receive Master's degrees in both Gerontology and Social Work. I feel that my passion was most clearly revealed to me during my time spent working with cancer patients and their caregivers.</p>
                                <p>I specialize in working with adults facing health and aging concerns, specifically chronic symptom (pain) management, caregiver support, and grief counseling. I both appreciate and deeply understand the complex rigors of aging and managing chronic illness. I am committed to walking this path with you as you develop the capacity to meet these challenges.</p>
                                <p>I believe we can partner in our work together in helping you develop the capacities you need to manage life's joys and difficulties, and build a more purposeful and meaningful life.</p>
