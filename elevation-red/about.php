                                    At Woodhaven our primary focus is to provide
                                    our clients with a healing experienceâ€”our
                                    facility reflects this. Newly renovated,
                                    thoughtfully designed, and nestled into an acre
                                    of forested land, our office is inviting and
                                    comfortable. The waiting room offers beautiful
                                    views that bring a connection to nature even
                                    though we are located in the city just off of
                                    3300 South and Highland Drive.</p>
                                <p>
                                    From a clinical perspective, your experience of
                                    feeling safety and connection is enhanced in
                                    these surroundings that engage your senses.
                                    Simply walking into the building provides you
                                    with an initial experience of being grounded
                                    and sets the stage for the work ahead as you
                                    begin the process of healing.
                                </p>
