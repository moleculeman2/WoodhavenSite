								<p>You have tried so many things to feel better about yourself but nothing is working long term. You feel frustrated, confused, and even overwhelmed. Your friends and family give you advice that doesn’t help and you’re left feeling like no one gets it. Life may even feel hopeless. You begin to ask yourself if something is fundamentally wrong with you. I get it. I’ve been there and so have many of my clients. As a therapist, I want to help you create a life where your friends and family are asking, “Wow, what are you doing differently? You seem so alive and engaged in life.” </p>
                                <p>You’ll learn new skills that allow you to be present, more intentional and more effective in your life. You'll gain capacities to confront and hold the pain in your life differently while creating a plan through meaningful action toward a values-driven life. Your relationships will become more meaningful and you’ll feel capable of handling life's challenges.</p>
                                <p>My education includes a master’s degree in psychology, as well as four years of PhD level coursework in psychology from Utah State University. I also have specialized post-graduate training as a food addiction counselor. I’ve walked this difficult and rewarding path with others and I know how to help you.</p>
